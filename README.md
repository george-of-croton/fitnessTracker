#Command Line Fitness Tracker
A simple command line tool that allows you to enter information about your workouts right from your terminal!


##Setup

####Step 1.
Clone this repository and navigate to the directory in your terminal.

####Step 2.
Install dependencies by typing "'npm i'" into your terminal.

####Step 3.
Since this project uses knex.js you will also need to install knex globally by typing "'npm i -g knex'" into your terminal.

####Step 4.
Initiate your workout database by typing "knex:migrate latest" into your terminal. This should create a directory called "migrations" with a migration file inside.

AND THAT'S IT. YOU ARE ALL SETUP AND READY TO START TRACKING YOUR FITNESS REGIME!
